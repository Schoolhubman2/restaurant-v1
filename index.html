		<h2>About Chick Fil' A!</h2>
			<p style="color:white;">Chick Fil’ A™ is a fast food restaurant well known for their chicken sandwich. “We didn’t invent the chicken, just the Chicken Sandwich™”. However, while the truth of the claim is mostly obscure today, some believe that they were the first in the fast food market to sell such a delicacy. Like McDonalds, they have their own meal packs, including kid’s meals, and thus you may get some of their tasty waffle fries along with your order. They also have their own wide selection of sauces for you to choose from.</p><br>
			<img src="img/place.png" width="500px"><br>
			<p style="color:white;">The choices continue with drinks, such as Dr. Pepper, Chocolate Milk, Lemonade, and believe it or not, ice cold refreshing water. Along with their Main lunch, they also have several breakfast meals to choose from.  The reason this restaurant is closed on Sundays was because Truett Cathy, the founder, saw the importance of closing on Sunday and wanted his employees to rest and worship if they choose". Chick Fil' A specializes in chicken-based meals...and then some. So there's always a surprise when you step on the mat of this family-fined fast-food restaurant.</p>
